0.17.2
 - Fix more regressions from 0.16.6 (affected packages included
   gnome-keyring, hsndfile and cuda)
 - Add regression suite tests to reduce chances of future regressions


0.17.1

 - Fix regressions from 0.16.6 (caused by fix for issue #45)
 - Version number bump (should have been done in the last release)


0.16.6

 - Trivial integer casts in enum defines supporting typedefs [Anton Dessiatov]
 - Allow forward definition of enums (issue #23)
 - Binding of C enums with aliases (issue #38)
 - Default marshallers for enum and pointer hooks (issue #31)
 - Remove dependencies on C2HS module from marshalling code (issue #37)
 - Problem with MacOS blocks notation (issue #29)
 - Include directive on first line produces invalid Haskell (issue #16)
 - Add command-line switch to suppress GNU preprocessor symbols (issue #60)
 - Fix size and alignment computation of bitfields [Facundo Dominguez]
 - Allow prefixes to be replaced, not just removed (issue #19)
 - Allow reference to structure tags from accessors (issue #54)
   For access paths for {#get#}, {#set#}, etc., one can now specify
   that structure tags are to be searched preferentially by saying,
   for example, {#get struct _point->y#} instead of {#get _point->y#}.
   The latter case will search for typedef names first and only then
   structure tags.
 - Support for anonymous enums (issue #43)
 - with... unwrapper type declarations for pointer hooks (issue #44)
 - {#fun...#} indentation for use in where clauses (issue #45)
 - incorrect method names from terminal class in superclass
   instances (issue #21)
 - "offsetof" directive (issue #22)
 - --include flag cannot handle windows paths (issue #30)
   Now uses System.FilePath splitSearchPath function, which should be
   platform-agnostic.
 - Void functions produce "defined but not used" warning (issue #47)
   Handle fun hooks with a void result using ">>" instead of ">>=".
 - Add CPP undefine flags for Gnu compiler defines (issue #51)
 - Cabal test suite
